1. Assess the vulnerability of the cat in the image — the degree to which the photograph captures the cat in a moment of unguarded openness. Look for signs that the cat is not performing or posing but simply existing without self-consciousness: sleeping in positions that defy dignity, mid-yawn with its whole mouth on absurd display, eyes half-closed in a slow blink of trust, or body gone completely soft in a way that suggests total safety. The more the image feels like a private moment the viewer was not meant to see — honest, unposed, and unselfconscious — the higher it should score. Images where the cat appears stiff, alert to the camera, or visually striking but emotionally guarded should score lower. The key question is: does this image invite empathy by showing the cat with its defenses down?

2. Assess the narrative atmosphere of the image — the degree to which the photograph suggests an emotional world beyond the edges of the frame. Look for the interplay between the cat and its surroundings: the quality of light, the mood of the setting, and whether the context implies a story or feeling the viewer can step into. A kitten asleep inside a shoe tells a story about smallness and the desire to be enclosed. A cat silhouetted on a wall at dusk tells a story about solitude and the passage of time. A cat at a rain-streaked window invites the viewer to wonder what it is thinking. The more the image generates involuntary narrative in the viewer's imagination — the more it feels like a world with emotional weather rather than a flat record of a cat in a place — the higher it should score. Images where the cat is isolated against a plain or featureless background, giving the viewer nothing to enter or imagine, should score lower.

3. Assess the spontaneous delight of the image — the degree to which the photograph produces an immediate, involuntary emotional response before the viewer has time to analyze it. This is the stop-scrolling quality: the sudden laugh at a cat wedged into a container far too small for its body, the sharp pang of affection at a kitten reaching one paw toward the camera, the flash of wonder at a cat caught mid-leap with improbable grace. Look for humor, absurdity, unforced beauty, and surprise — moments that feel alive and unrepeatable rather than composed or curated. The key distinction is between images that feel like encounters and images that feel like compositions. The more the image ambushes the heart with feeling the viewer did not expect and did not choose, the higher it should score. Images that are pleasant or technically accomplished but predictable and emotionally inert should score lower.
