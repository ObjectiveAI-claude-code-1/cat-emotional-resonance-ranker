Rank the provided cat pictures by their emotional resonance — the degree to which each image stirs genuine feeling in the viewer. Images that create delight, tenderness, humor, wonder, or quiet contemplation should rank higher. Look for images that move past being merely a visual record and become something felt — where there is an emotional bridge between the cat's experience and the human viewer. A cat mid-yawn with absurd vulnerability, a kitten curled into an impossibly small ball, or a cat staring out a rain-streaked window with perfect stillness all exemplify strong emotional resonance. Images that are technically competent but emotionally flat should rank lower than images that are imperfect but alive with feeling. The task is to measure charm — that hard-to-name quality that makes a person stop, smile, or feel a pang of affection.
